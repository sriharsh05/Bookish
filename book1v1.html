                <p>Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and he's stuck with his heartless relatives,
                     who force him to live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he receives a 
                     letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from 
                     his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
                </p>
                <p>After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid.
                    But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only 
                    person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal 
                    takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.
                </p>
                <p>Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a dangerous
                     secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling 
                     into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.</p>
